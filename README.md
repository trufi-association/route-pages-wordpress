Trufi Route Pages is a Wordpress plugin developed by [The Trufi Association](https://trufi.app/) to complement the Trufi mobile application. It allows Wordpress to receive a URL request containing a route ID and name and display it as a post. The plugin also generates a dynamic sitemap.xml based on route information from the openGraphql API.
